Janitor
=======

Janitor is a service running in the cloud that helps reduce the cost of cloud computing by removing unused resources.

Janitor applies a set of rules on each encountered cloud resource to determine if it is a candidate for removal. When a resource violates a rule, Janitor marks it with enough contextual information, schedules its removal then notify the resource owner.
