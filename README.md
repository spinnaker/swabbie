# Swabbie

_**IMPORTANT:** This service is currently under development and is not ready for production._

Swabbie is a service automating the cleanup of unused resources, such as EBS Volumes and Security Groups.
It's a replacement for Janitor Monkey. It can be exetnded to clean up a variety of resource types.
It applies a set of rules to mark cleanup candidates. Once marked, a resource is scheduled for deletion, and an owner is notified.

## Configuration

```


## Concepts
#### Agents
An agent is a scheduled class in charge of initiating and dispatching work to a resource type handler:

- `ResourceMarkerAgent`: Marks violating resources.
- `ResourceCleanerAgent`: Cleans marked resources.
- `NotificationAgent`: Ensures a notification is sent out to a resource owner.


#### Resource Type Handler
Handler's lifecycle: `Mark -> Notify -> Delete`.

Responsibilities include:
  - Retrieving upstream resources.
  - Marking resources violating rules.
  - Deleting a resource.

#### Work, Work, Work...
A single unit of work is scoped to a configuration that defines its granularity.

```
data class WorkConfiguration(
  val namespace: String,
  val account: Account,
  val location: String,
  val cloudProvider: String,
  val resourceType: String,
  val retentionDays: Int,
  val exclusions: List<Exclusion>,
  val dryRun: Boolean = true
)
```
Work configuration is derived from the YAML configuration.

#### Marking resources for deletions & Redis
A marker agent operates on a unit of work by acquiring a simple lock to avoid operating on work in progress.
The locking mechanism is backed by a distributed redis locking manager. The granularity of the lock name is 
`$action:$workConfiguration.namespace`.

```
locking:
  enabled: true
  maximumLockDurationMillis: 360000
  heartbeatRateMillis: 5000
  leaseDurationMillis: 30000
```

Scheduling the cleanup of resources is done by keeping an index of visited resources in a `ZSET`, using the projected deletion time as the `score`.
Getting elements from the `ZSET` from `-inf` to `now` will return all resources ready to be deleted.
Getting elements from the `ZSET` from `0.0` to `+inf` will return all currently marked resources.


#### Notifications
When resources are marked for deletion, a notification is sent to the owner.
Resource owners are resolved using resolution strategies. Default strategy is getting the email field on the resource's application.
The deletion of a resource will be adjusted when the notification is sent, respecting the retention days for the resource type.

#### Dry Run
This will ensure swabbie runs in dryRun, meaning no writes, nor any destructive action of the data will occur
```
swabbie:
  dryRun: true
```
It's also possible to turn on dryRun at a resource type level

#### Exclusion Policies
Resources can be excluded/opted out from consideration using exclusion policies.

- `ResourceExclusionPolicy`: Excludes resources at runtime


#### Whitelisting
Whitelisting is part of the exclusion mechanism. When defined, only resources whitelisted will be considered, 
skipping everything else not whitelisted.
